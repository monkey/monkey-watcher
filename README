Monkey Watcher (WatchMonkey)
============================
This program spawn Monkey HTTP Server in background and redirect it output
to a stdout.xyz file. Once a program crash is faced, a core dump is generated
and the server is restarted.

Initially written to monitor Duda I/O services, it can be used with any program,
please refer to the above instructions when monitoring Monkey or Duda service:

Build
=====
Just type make, e.g:

 $ make

Requirements
============
Before to launch this program make sure the shell is able to generate core dumps
upon segfault or crash detection:

 $ ulimit -c unlimited

Instruct the Kernel to generate core dumps which appends the PID number to the
core dump file generated:

 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid

 note: run this commands as root.

Running with Duda I/O
=====================
When running over a Duda I/O service, use the Monkey binary path as argument without
extra flags, e.g:

 # ./watchmonkey ~/.dudac/stage/monkey/bin/monkey

if the service was already ran by Duda Client Manager (dudaC) there is no extra
need to rebuilt or change any configuration.
